                    <p className="text-justify text-[#6b5a78]">The technology behind NOZE is based on a digital nose sensor (also known as an e-nose). With this sensor, NOZE can precisely detect a wide range of pollutants and chemicals. In contrast, almost all other air quality monitors on the market today use a bundle of off-the-shelf sensors that are limited in what they can detect and can vary widely in quality, accuracy and reliability.</p>
